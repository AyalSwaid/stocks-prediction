# stocks-prediction
Machine Learning project that predicts stocks behavior by analyzing tweets contents about each stock.

# Plan
1. classify each tweet and get its emotional (positive/negative) rate.
2. merge tweet emotion rate with stocks values according to their dates.
3. analyze the new dataset and train a ML model to predict stocks behavoir(maybe regression).

# Future plan
make auto predicting using the following process:
1. get some tweets using api
2. predict according to the tweets
3. show result as plots
